/** This is where the magic happens. We are going to use the index.ts file to import all the assets used in this folder. This is a good practice because it will help us to keep our code organized and clean. Static assets like images, fonts, etc.
 * 
 * When we import images we will need to use a different import. Since images don't have a default export, we will need to use the following syntax:
 * 
 * import image from './image.png'
 * 
 * image in this case provides a default name for the image, so we can use it in our code. We can name it whatever we want, but it is a good practice to name it the same as the image.
